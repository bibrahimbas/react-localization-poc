            Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has revealed the state's two roadmaps to easing lockdown restrictions, with metropolitan Melbourne remaining in stage four lockdown for at least an additional two weeks, until September 28.
However, the easing of restrictions will take place over four phases, Mr Andrews admitting the three-step "traffic light system" once planned had been scrapped.
The four phases include: Step One – September 14 (officially 11.59pm September 13); Step Two – September 28; Step Three – October 26 and Step Four (Last Step) – November 23 and finally a COVID Normal. The steps have case number markers to be met, in addition to the date.
